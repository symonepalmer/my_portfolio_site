	<p class="intro"> Here is my first paragraph. For now, I'm adding filler content. But as I enhance my page and advance my coding skills, I'll add more information to describe my experience. </p>

	<p> We're coming up on the 6-week mark of the LaunchCode CoderGirl program. I'm not entirely content with my progress (that's on me, of course. Procrastinated, as usual), but I'm confident that I can get to where I need to be within the next week. For now, I'm cramming in the basic knowledge I need in order to submit the first draft of my portfolio site. </p>
